# OJTrack Database Migration Policy

The final target model is `../schema.normalized.sql`.

Do not create a destructive "one shot" migration from the current database. OJTrack contains historical OJT records and uploaded files, so normalization must be staged and reversible.

## Planned migration packages

1. **001_core_identity_and_terms** — academic terms, OJT enrollments, company users, coordinator assignment history and placements.
2. **002_attendance** — attendance day/session model and correction audit trail.
3. **003_journals_and_attachments** — journal revisions and centralized private attachment metadata.
4. **004_requirements** — template/version/assignment/submission model.
5. **005_reports** — template/version/assignment/submission and evidence snapshots.
6. **006_evaluations** — immutable form versions, stable criteria, requests, submissions and answers.
7. **007_certificates_and_announcements** — issued certificate records and attachment linking.
8. **008_application_cutover** — switch PHP reads/writes to normalized tables after parity tests.
9. **009_legacy_retirement** — drop legacy columns/tables only after approved backup, parity and UAT.

Each executable migration must:
- record its version in `schema_migrations`;
- fail safely if prerequisites are not met;
- never delete source data in the same migration that first copies it;
- include a verification query/checklist;
- be rehearsed against a restored staging copy before production.
